2. **Health Monitoring**: Automated checks ensure new version is healthy
3. **Traffic Testing**: Test both stable and canary versions simultaneously
4. **Real-time Feedback**: See deployment progress in Argo Rollouts UI

#### **🔵🔴 Blue-Green Deployment Demo**
1. **Environment Switching**: Watch blue (stable) and green (preview) environments
2. **Zero Downtime**: Traffic switches instantly between environments
3. **Manual Promotion**: Control when to promote the green environment
4. **Automatic Rollback**: Failed deployments automatically rollback

#### **🔄 Rolling Update Demo**
1. **Pod-by-Pod Updates**: See pods update one by one
2. **Health Checks**: Automatic verification of each pod
3. **Zero Downtime**: Application remains accessible throughout
4. **Rollback Capability**: Easy rollback to previous version

#### **📊 Monitoring & Metrics**
1. **Real-time Dashboards**: ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts UIs
2. **Deployment Status**: Live status of all deployments
3. **Health Metrics**: Success rates and error monitoring
4. **Traffic Analysis**: See which version is serving traffic
